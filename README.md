In this repository you can find all the data, commonds for simulations and demographic models for the paper "XXX". 

There are two sub-folders: one called "Simulations" where you can find all commands, data and models used for the creation of simulated datasets and their analyses. The second sub-folder, called "Turbots_demography" contains data and models used for the demographic analyses of *Schopthalmus maximus*. 

In both folders i also provide the final results of all analyses, but not intermidiate files.
