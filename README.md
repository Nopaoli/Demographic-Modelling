# Demographic analyses

In this repository you can find data, commands for simulations and demographic models for the preprint "*Biases in demographic modelling affect our understanding of the process of speciation*" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.128298)

There are two sub-folders: one called "Simulations" where you can find commands, data and models used for the creation of simulated datasets and their analyses. The second sub-folder, called "Turbots_demography" contains data and models used for the demographic analyses of *Schopthalmus maximus*.
