## Data and models for analyses of empirical data

Here you find the folded jSFS for Baltic Sea and North Sea turbots (NS_BS_unlinked_dadi.data) used in the bioRxiv preprint "Biases in demographic modelling affect our understanding of the process of speciation" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.128298). The file is in the form of a dadi data dictionary. Please note that the sequences for reference and outgroup are the same, as the alleles are not polarized. You should only use the dictionary to get the folded jSFS.

In the subfolders you will find the *moments* models and *Stairway plot* blueprint files to repeat the demographic analyses.
