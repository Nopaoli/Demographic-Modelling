## Data and models for analyses of empirical data

Here you find the folded jSFS for Baltic Sea and North Sea turbots used in the bioRxiv preprint "Biases in demographic modelling affect our understanding of the process of speciation" (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.128298)

In the subfolders you will find the *moments* models and *Stairway plot* blueprint files to repeat the demographic analyses.
