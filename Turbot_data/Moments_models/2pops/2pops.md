# Two-population models for *Moments*

Here are the 32 two-population models tested in paper. 

They represent a fully orthoginal combination of teh following scenarios: 

Gene Flow= Isolation with Migration vs Secondary Contact, both with contemporary asymmetric migration

" Genomic islands" models = models with (2M models)  or without heterogeneous migration rates across the genome 
Backgroundselection/sweeps models = models with (2N models)  or without heterogeneous Ne  across the genome 
Ancestral expansion models= models with (AE models) or without Ne change in the ancestral population before the split
"Founder" models =models with (B models) or without a bottleneck followed by growth at the time of split in the Baltic Sea population
